# mass2chem: Annotation and Inferrence


## Annotation step 1 of LC-MS data involves:

- possible contaminants
- isotopic peaks
- adducts, fragments, multimers 

The grouping of degenerate peaks is mostly based on common mass patterns.
Peak shapes are often useful.
Statistical correlation between peak intensities can be useful but often overstated.


## Annotation step 2 involves:

- matching to libraries of authentic chemical standards.

This is usually generated in house on the same platform. MS/MS is required in establishing the libraries.

Matching requires on both m/z and retentiion time.


## Annotation step 3 involves:

Database searches for LC-MS features.

## Annotation step 4 involves:

MS2 and MS^n data.
